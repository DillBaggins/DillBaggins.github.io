As part of a university assignment, myself and a partner designed a cascade-style controller for a large DC motor. This project involved the system identification, controller design, controller simulation as well as controller implementation on a Delta PLC and HMI system. 

This project was a learning experience and provided an opportunity to get some hands on experience designing controllers for non-linear systems. 

The full report for this project can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl}}{% link docs/WHTDYL001_Prac_2_Report.pdf %})
