Over the 2021/2022 long vactation I interned at the African Robotics Unit (ARU) at the university under Dr Paul Amayo. Here I was tasked with the creation of a point cloud labelling application using the [Open3D](http://www.open3d.org/) library.

This application was written in Python and allowed the user to view and annotate several point clouds. It also contained several utilities allowing the user to export created annotations in a variety of formats including those used for the [KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/) datasets.

This project was very rewarding and afforded me the opportunity to gain more familiarity with software engineering practices as well as learn more about the machine learning applications of point cloud data for self-driving cars.
