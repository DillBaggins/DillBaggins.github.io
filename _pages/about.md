Below, I have written about some of my personal interests and hobbies. In both my professional and personal life, I tend to find a great variety of things interesting and worth persuing so don't be surprised if this list changes frequently. 

Some of my current interests include
- [Motorbikes](#motorbikes)
- [The great Outdoors ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³](#the-great-outdoors-)
- [Skateboarding](#skateboarding)
- [Running](#running)


## Motorbikes
I have been riding since 2017 and have fallen in love with the freedom it brings. Going for a "breakfast run" with friends is of the most delightful experiences in life. At the moment I am currently exploring and enjoyiong the adventure bike lifestyle and have been blessed enough to have been on quite a few bike camping trips with my dad. I have also enjoyed taking a bike around the track and can definitely see myself doing more of that in the future.

        <img class="card-img-top" src="{{ img }}" />
    </div>

## The great Outdoors ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³
I have a great passion for being in nature. As such I am truly blessed to live in the Western Cape. In fact, easy access to the Drakensburg just about the only thing I miss from living in Johannesburg.

## Skateboarding
A very new interest of mine is skateboarding. I am appreciating the amount of work and dedication it takes to improve

## Running
While I wouldn't say running is a passion of mine, I do appreciate a good run to start the day and going for a run with a friend or two is always a great time.
